# FuzzyOpen
Fuzzy File open extension for Visual Studio.

This is an extension attempting to provide fuzzyfinder-like functionality for Visual Studio 2013 and 2015. By default, it attempts to set the hotkey as **Alt+O**, but you can change it from Tools->Options->Environment->Keyboard to be whatever you wish. The menu command created is **File->Fuzzy Open File**.

## Super-Quick user guide
Start typing some parts of the filename you wish to open. If you are happy with the first suggestion, you can just press **Enter**.
If not, either continue typing or select the correct file from the list with either **Tab/Shift-Tab**, **Up/Down arrow keys** or **double-click**.
